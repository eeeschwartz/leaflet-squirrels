      These are amazing times we live in. Just pat your mouse and keyboard with your paws a few times and you can have an informative, interactive map up on the tubez in no time! Certainly much easier than finding those acorns in the park you were hiding from Gerry (Seriously, Gerry. Go find your own nuts!) I digress...
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, using open source components, the following instructions will get you flying into web-mapping. This exercise assumes a knowledge of HTML and Javascript - but not at all required. This will step through each phase of what you see to the right. Just keep on scrolling down in this panel. If you get lost at anytime just ask for help. Someone will be there to scrape you off the road and get you back on your feet again!

      Enough chatter! Let's go nuts with Leaflet!

    <h2 id="data">Data: You can get it!</h2>
    <p>
      When trying to learn a new mapping technology, it can sometimes be easy to get hung up on what to map as an example. Lots of things exist on this planet and that means there are a lot of things that could be mapped. To deal with the data hangup, I've taken the liberty of providing some prepared data for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      January 21st is Squirrel Appreciation Day. This is according to the internet, so you know it's true! As such, we're going to be doing some mapping with a squirrel them (Take that maptimeBoston rats!). Now, Lexington doesn't collect data about squirrels. In fact, there's not a lot of publicly available data about squirrels. They can be a very withholding species, so I had to get creative. Inspired by Andrew Shears' map of the US broken into breakaway states, I wondered "What if the squirrels took over? What would the newly drawn boundaries of the Squirrel States of America look like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It's difficult to understand the political psychology of squirrels. If you've ever seen them battle over who gets to be on what side of a tree, you know that territorial demarcation is generally a fluid concept. However, let's suspend reality for a bit and assume that squirrels deal in a post-Westphalian notion of territory (whatever that means!). Using data from the Geographic Name Information System (GNIS), a part of the USGS I found 21 settlements (census designated areas, locales, and populated places) that included the term "squirrel". This data includes latitude and longitude so it can be mapped with minimal clean-up. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main datasets we'll be working with that are derived from this GNIS data. The first one is called ssa-capitals.geojson. This is a point dataset that shows the location of the 21 squirrelly places filtered from that full GNIS dataset. We'll be using them as capitals for our Squirrel States of America (SSA). Check it out <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/blob/master/ssa-capitals.geojson" target="_blannk">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second dataset is ssa-states.geojson. This is polygon dataset showing the extent of each squirrel state in the SSA. They are simply Voronoi polygons created in QGIS that were clipped by the boundaries of the the USA. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/blob/master/ssa-states.geojson" target="_blank">here</a>.Surely there are other more creative methods for drawing these boundaries. Feel free to create your own. I suggest using a cool tool called <a href="http://geojson.io/" target="_blank">GeoJSON.io</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="base">Tile Basemap</h2>
    <p>
      The second element of this project is the basemap. To keep it simple, we are going to use a service provider rather than build our own server stack. We'll learn more about that in the future, but let's make things easier on ourselves with the help of our friends out west at Stamen Design.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://mapstack.stamen.com/" target="_blank">MapStack</a> is an awesome project that will allow us to create some free map tiles using OpenStreetMap. The image filters and effects offer a wide variety of customization. When you're happy with what you've came up with copy/paste the tile url of the image. It's rather long, but required for inserting into our code. For this example our url is
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
      <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
        <pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">http://{s}.sm.mapstack.stamen.com/((terrain-background,$7f8c8d[hsl-color])[multiply],$a35229[@80p],(mapbox-water,$000[@25],$fff[hsl-saturation@50],$2c3e50[hsl-color]))/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</pre>

    <h2 id="gh-pages">Hosting with GitHub Pages</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is great resource for code-sharing, development, and storage. An added bonus is the automatic page generator for any repository you create. We will use this for hosting our web-app and storing all of the necessary components. Think of it as your personal set of chubby squirrel cheeks!
    </p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/master/squirrel-cheeks.jpg" style="width: 75%" class="img-center">
    <p>
    When you store your project there will a be total of 5 files in your repository that that run your app. Once you have enabled your github pages branch, you can delete everything except for the index.html file. It will keep all the code for your app, you can rename it if you like as well. Our <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels" target="_blank">sample repository</a> demonstrates the set-up for this project.

    <h2>Leaflet...at last!</h2>
    <p>
      Leaflet is the <it>hocus pocus</it> behind may of today's web-mapping applications. It provides an extensive library of functions supported by a dedicated team of contributors. We are going to use the <a href="http://leafletjs.com" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a> library to create our map. Using the documentation from the Leaflet.js website, we are going to start with the most basic components needed for a map. We are going to:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Add Leaflet starter code</li>
      <li>Specify the lat/long of our location</li>
      <li>Add our tile layer URL from MapStack</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="examples">

    <h2 id="ssa-capitals">Adding Feature Data: SSA Capitals</bg>
    <p>
      We have a pretty <it>unnerving</it>  map so far. Let's add our .geojson file we made earlier. An added step is using a <a href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js" target="_blank">jQuery</a> library to handle the interaction of our data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are going to:
    </p> 
      <ol class="lst-lowalph">
        <li>Reference jQuery in the html <em>head</em></li>
        <li>Load our data</li>
        <li>Add it to the map</li>
      </ol>
    <p class="examples">

    <h2 id="custom-icon">Custom Icon</h2>
    <p>
      Our country has been taken over by egomaniacal squirrels. Would they really be satisfied with DEFAULT icons? We must keep them pleased! Fortunately, Leaflet allows us to use our own icons. <a href="https://github.com/maptime/hrva/blob/gh-pages/ghosts/boo.gif" target="_blank">Here's one that will remind our squirrel overlords that they indeed are the rulers of us all</a>! Mwahsqueeksqueeksqueeksqueek!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one step here lets:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Add a new icon</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

                                            <br>So we have some pretty <it>frightening</it>  icons for our dots, but we really
                                              want to tell the viewer what they are. Let's add some pop-ups from our data's
                                              attributes: a) create the pop-up b) format the text c) optionally style with css
